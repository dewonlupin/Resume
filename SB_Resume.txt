EXPERIENCE
	Core Graphics Software Engineer 	                                     Intel Corporation 	                                                 Sept 2021 - Aug 2022
*	Developed Intel Integrated/Discrete graphics drivers for Intel's present and upcoming platforms tailored for Windows primarily 
focusing on kernel-mode drivers and graphics memory management along with GPU Scheduling Firmware.
*	Developed proficiency with WDDM (Window Display Driver Model) APIs and delved into the graphics pipeline.
*	Collaborated in the implementation of Level-0 Sysman for Windows, telemetry, frequency, and power control.
*	Validation and debugging of the Intel GPU Graphics Driver under Virtualized Environments like KVM GT under Windows.
*	Resolved customer issues involving memory dumps, display screen corruption, timeout, and synchronization issues.
SAP HANA Developer                                                            Waddaya Solution                                                May 2015 - Aug 2018
*	Led data modeling and analytical view development in SAP HANA, emphasizing data management, reporting, and 
collaboration with the security team for holistic business process improvements.
*	Developed and deployed 20+ custom automation tools using Bash and Python; slashed effort reduction by 50%-60%. 
*	Automated system backups and designed real-time monitoring alerts using shell scripting for critical systems.
*	Managed Linux-based production servers, ensuring production server uptime and optimal system performance.
*	Collaborated with the security team to perform regular audits, and vulnerability assessments and implement best security 
practices.
PROJECTS
*	GPU Telemetry Tool for Intel (C++, CMake, Git, QuickBuild): Designed Intel's GPU telemetry tool, capturing metrics such as 
core usage and memory bandwidth. Employed Intel's SDK for direct GPU interfacing, leveraging both continuous and event-
driven sampling. Aggregated data for clarity and ensured efficient storage with real-time visualization. Further extended the 
telemetry tool with a CLI for enhanced debugging, achieving a 25% reduction in debug time.
*	E-Signature management system for CalPERS (Python, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, XAMP, OpenCV, Pillow) Conceptualized 
and deployed an E-Signature portal for CalPERS, emphasizing business process improvement, secure data management, and 
user-centric design. Application features: encrypted database, in-page signature drawing, two-factor user authentication, and 
password policies, The Backend of the application handles the elimination of noise from the image by reducing the aspect 
ratio, converting the image to grayscale, and applying canny edge detection to make the uploaded image usable.
*	Autonomous Line Follower Robot (C, ATmega168 (Arduino Duemilanove), Motor Driver, Infrared sensor): Successfully 
designed and implemented a fully functional autonomous line follower robot using an ATmega168 microcontroller, motor 
driver, and infrared sensors. Utilized the ATmega168 microcontroller for movement control and infrared sensors for path 
tracking. 
*	A Dashboard for Canines Suffering from CHF (Python, Matplotlib, Plotly, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit): Crafted a 
dashboard using Streamlit and Scikit-learn in Python that classifies the current condition of canines suffering from Congenital 
Heart Failure with 98% success rate with features like generating PDF reports of the patient with interactive charts made in 
real time just after the user inputs.
